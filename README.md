## Website Instructions:
[Link to Website] (https://liam-lee-66.github.io/SD160-Techinical-Writing-Skills---Final-Project-Portofolio/
)
The link to the website itself should be attatched to my submittion. Another link should be the link to my Github repository. The website should be hosted from my GitHub account. 
Apparently I was not able to make a dropdown menu for the Articles. You will be needing to press either the **back** button on the browser, or press the **Articles** tab to select the other article. Sorry about that.
Please do not press the **Submit** button in the **Contact me** page. Apparently there is an issue where the website will somehow freakout and give you an error 405. This will only happen when you complete the **text boxes** and then click the **Submit** button.
