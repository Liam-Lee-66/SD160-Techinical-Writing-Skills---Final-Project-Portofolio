                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Star Wars: Battlefront 2</strong>, is a well-known game to many Star Wars fans, thanks to its
                    many popular
                    game modes. One of the most popular game modes is <strong>Heroes vs Villains</strong>.
                    <strong>Heroes vs Villains</strong> is a 4 vs 4
                    or a 2 vs 2 duels between Heroes and Villains. In this game mode, you can select a hero or a villain
                    that has appeared in the Star Wars films, and fight your opponents.
                </p>
                <p>The game mode <strong>Heroes vs Villains</strong> can be overwhelming for new players, due to their
                    low level and
                    experience. This guide will be helping out the new players how to level up their character
                    efficiently, and how to duel their opponents to their advantage.
                </p>

                <h2>Heads Up!</h2>
                <p>This guide is based on what I have learned throughout my experience playing the game. There can be
                    some information missing or added compared to other guides.</p>
                <p>This guide does not go over the basic controls of the video game. I recommend trying the tutorial
                    first and then going over this guide.</p>

                <h2>Strengthening Characters</h2>
                <h3>Star Cards</h3>
                <p>Levelling up characters is one of the most important things to do if you wish to get stronger. When
                    players level up, they receive ‘points’ which can be used to buy or upgrade <strong>Star
                        Cards</strong>. These <strong>Star Cards</strong> are used to upgrade the character’s abilities.
                    Meaning, the higher level, the stronger your character is. Thanks to these ability upgrades, you can
                    have an advantage in defeating your opponent.</p>

                <img src="../assets/img/Articles/WT5/Star Cards.png" alt="Image showing starcards in-game">

                <p>Star Card upgrades can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increase in maximum health</li>
                    <li>Increase in normal attack damage, but with more cost on Stamina</li>
                    <li>Increased range in abilities</li>
                    <li>Increased damage in abilities </li>
                    <li>Decreased ability cool downtime</li>
                    <li>Decrease incoming damage</li>
                    <li>Etc</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Levelling Up</h3>
                <p>There are many different ways to level up your characters. However, many of those ways are not very
                    efficient. The most efficient way of upgrading any character is by playing <strong>Co-op</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>The game mode <strong>Co-op</strong> is where 4 players team up and try to defeat the AI enemies.
                    Thanks to the AI’s low difficulty, new players can easily get used to their characters and earn
                    experience points.</p>
                <p>There are many different battle situations in <strong>Co-op</strong>, preventing the players to get
                    bored while playing. Players can also select any era they wish to fight in. They can fight during
                    the <strong>Clone Wars</strong>, the <strong>Galactic Civil War</strong>, or during the
                    <strong>sequel trilogy</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>Lightsaber Duelling</h2>
                <p>One of the most common mistakes that new players make while lightsaber duelling is <strong>spamming
                        melee attacks</strong>. Similar to real-life duelling, this will leave the character
                    <strong>vulnerable</strong> to the opponent’s attacks. This can be because of you wasting your
                    stamina, or the opponent is parrying your attacks.
                </p>
                <p>Timing is the most important when duelling. You must control when to strike and when to not. Not only
                    this will help you to control the usage of your stamina, but this will also prevent you from rushing
                    into battle without any second thoughts.
                </p>

                <h3>Stamina Control</h3>
                <p>Stamina will be used when attacking and defending. For some characters, stamina can be also used for
                    using the character’s ability. When the character’s stamina is depleted, the character is no longer
                    able to attack or defend. Stamina will recharge when not attacking or defending. The recharging will
                    stop when you start attacking or defending.
                </p>

                <p><a
                    class="red" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GhBrEpT40WMDQ9oaXrd2kMn-y64_RCy7/view?usp=sharing">Here's</a>
                    a video demonstration</p>

                <p>You can also see how much stamina your opponents have. This will come in very handy since you can
                    compare your stamina and the opponents. This could help you make decisions as to whether to attack
                    your opponent or fall back.
                </p>

                <h3>Parrying</h3>
                <p>Parrying is a difficult skill to master, but it is the most useful skill to have. Parrying is when a
                    player blocks an incoming attack and strikes back immediately after. Every character will have a
                    short second where they are vulnerable to attacks right after when they strike. The split second of
                    vulnerability is what you will be needing to aim for when parrying.
                </p>
                <p>To parry, you will be needing to block the first attack. Blocking the first attack will make the
                    opponent locate themselves into your striking zone. While blocking, when you hear the lightsabers
                    clashing, you will need to strike (if you wish to). Depending on the character’s striking speed, you
                    will be needing to adjust when to strike. However, the sound of the lightsabers clashing should be
                    the benchmark for you to when to strike.
                </p>

                <p>Here’s a table of all Heroes and Villains depending on their striking speed:</p>
                <p class="red">Warning: This graph is based on my experience, it may differ from other guides.</p>
                <table class="WT5-Table">
                    <tr>
                        <th class="s">Short</th>
                        <th class="m">Medium</th>
                        <th class="l">Long</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Obi-Wan Kenobi</td>
                        <td>Luke Skywalker</td>
                        <td>Darth Maul</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Count Dooku</td>
                        <td>Rey</td>
                        <td>General Grievous</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Darth Vader</td>
                        <td>Kylo Ren</td>
                        <td>Yoda</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td> - </td>
                        <td>Anakin Skywalker</td>
                        <td> - </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>Parrying is only useful when you have only one opponent to focus your defence on. Meaning, when you
                    are surrounded by several opponents, parrying won’t be the greatest option to use.
                </p>
                <p>Another downside of parrying is related to the usage of your stamina. As said above, you will be
                    needing to block the opponent’s attack and then strike immediately. Obviously, this will
                    <strong>cost a lot of stamina</strong> because you are blocking an attack and then striking. This is likely to
                    repeat, so you
                    won’t be able to recharge unless you start dodging. Make sure to be aware of your stamina at all
                    times.
                </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Remember to always think about which action to make rather than striking without any other thoughts. This will prevent you from making any unnecessary risks during the fight.</p>
                <p>Always be aware of your surroundings. This includes your stamina, the opponent’s stamina, and the opponent’s position. Stamina control is crucial to attack and defend. Compare your stamina and your opponent’s to make decisions as to whether to strike the opponent or back away. Make sure to strike, when the opponent is in range. If not this will leave you vulnerable, and give the opponent the advantage.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, never, ever spam your attacks. This can cost your stamina, but most importantly, your opponent can easily parry you.</p>
                <p>Good luck, or in other words, May the force be with you!</p>
