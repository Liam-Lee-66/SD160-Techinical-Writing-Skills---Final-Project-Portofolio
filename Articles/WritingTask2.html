                <p>What are Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)? Both SSL and TLS are
                    protocols that are responsible for making a secure internet connection between two different
                    systems. This secure data transfer prevents any criminals from reading or editing the data that is
                    getting transferred between the two systems. The difference between both SSL and TLS is basically
                    when they first came out. TLS is known as SSL’s successor, meaning it’s an upgraded version of SSL.
                </p>

                <h2>Try it Yourself</h2>
                <p>You can easily indicate if SSL/TLS is being used on a website. Simply check the top side of your
                    browser and look for the website’s URL address. If the URL address starts with “HTTPS”, then the
                    website has been confirmed or verified to be secure. However, if the URL address starts with “HTTP”,
                    it means the website has not yet been confirmed or verified to be secure.</p>
                <img src="https://gloify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SSL-Example.png" alt="Image showing the difference between HTTPS and HTTP">
                <p>There are also visual indicators in browsers to determine if your website is secure or not. Simply
                    find the lock icon next to the website’s URL address. Most web browsers have their visual indicators
                    located on the left-hand side of where the URL address is located. Others are mostly located on the
                    right-hand side of where the URL address is located. When the lock icon is not shown and something
                    else or nothing is shown, it means the website is not secure. </p>

                
                <h2>HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>

                <img src="https://seopressor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Difference-Between-HTTP-and-HTTPS.png" alt="Image shows how HTTPS is secure and HTTP is not">

                <p>After reading the paragraph above, you may wonder if all HTTP is insecure. The answer is no. Let’s go over this in detail. </p>
                <p>The main purpose of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is to show the client a functioning website. You can interact with the website, navigate around several pages and you will not have any issues. However, the HTTP website is not meant for any secure data transfers between the client and the server. As an example, if you are entering your personal information to login into an HTTP website, there is a possibility where a cybercriminal may interact with your inputted data during its transfer to the server. This type of cyberattack is well known to cybersecurity specialists as, Man-In-The-Middle Attack.</p>
                <p>To prevent this issue, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was invented. HTTPS does the same job as HTTP, but HTTPS uses SSL to encrypt its information for secure data transfer between the client and server. Here’s an example; Most of the websites you visit, that is needing any type of your personal information are using HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>
