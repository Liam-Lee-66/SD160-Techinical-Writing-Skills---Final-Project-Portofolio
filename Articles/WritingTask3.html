                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>To make a website there are several processes. One of the processes is the programmer communicating
                    with the browser how their website should look like. However, the browser does not speak the human
                    language, so the programmer can’t communicate with the server with the human language. "Then how
                    will we make our website?" You may ask. For that to be possible we use something called Hypertext
                    Markup Language (HTML). <strong>HTML is a programming language that we use to tell the browser what
                        we want on our website.</strong> As an example, if you wish to have a Title, Paragraph, or even
                    an image on your website, you will be using HTML to tell the browser what you want.</p>

                <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                <p>Have you ever seen a website without CSS in 2021? I bet you haven’t. Here’s the reason why:</p>
                <img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s_601945040BCA3610D759145A4442799C97B904D9A9F8326DD30FDF0CF48A96B7_1555165941350_amazon-compare.jpg?ssl=1"
                    alt="Image showing what a website will look like if CSS is not used.">

                <p>To not make an old and bad-looking website, we use something called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
                    While HTML shows how the content of the website should look, CSS edits how the HTML should be shown
                    in a browser. In very simple words, <strong>CSS changes how the HTML looks</strong>.</p>
                <p>Here’s an example; Here’s what it looks like to have HTML only:</p>
                <img src="../assets/img/Articles/WT3/noCSS.png" alt="Website with no CSS">

                <p>Here's what it looks like when I add CSS to the website:</p>
                <img src="../assets/img/Articles/WT3/withCSS.png" alt="Image of a website with CSS">
                <p>As I said before, CSS is a visual editor for the HTML to make the HTML much interesting. You can add
                    colours, different fonts, and even relocate specific items wherever you want.</p>

                <h2>Let's get deeper into it!</h2>
                <p>While we are programming, we must let the browser know what we want to add, edit, or even change. To
                    communicate with the browser, we use something called HTML tags. <strong>HTML tags tell the browser
                        which specific element we wish to edit in our website</strong>. HTML tags contain three main
                    parts: an opening, the content, and the closing tag.</p>
                <p>Here’s how they look like (red = opening, blue = content, green = closing):</p>
                <img src="../assets/img/Articles/WT3/log.png"
                    alt="Image showing HTML codes, with Red, Blue, Green highlights for tags and contents">
                <p>With these tags, you can add whatever you want in HTML. Here’s a small tip from me; As you may have
                    already realized, there is a very easy way to indicate if a tag is an opening tag or a closing tag.
                    Simply look for a “/” in front of the tag name, this means it’s a closing tag.</p>
